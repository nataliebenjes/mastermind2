# Mastermind Game

Welcome to the Mastermind game! Can you crack the code?

## Overview

This Mastermind game allows you to play against the computer. The computer will randomly select a pattern of four different numbers from a total of 8 different numbers (allowing duplicates). Your goal is to guess the correct combination within 10 attempts.

## Game Rules

- The computer will randomly select a pattern of four different numbers at the start of the game.
- You have 10 attempts to guess the number combinations.
- After each guess, the computer will provide feedback in the form of:
  - Correctly guessed number
  - Correctly guessed number and its correct location
  - Incorrect guess


## User Interface

You can interact with the game through the provided user interface, which includes:

- Ability to guess combinations of 4 numbers
- View the history of guesses and their feedback
- Display of the number of guesses remaining

## Implementation

You are free to choose the programming languages, tools, frameworks, and libraries you find appropriate within reason. The only restriction is not to use a game framework that implements Mastermind.

### API Integration

The game utilizes the [Random Number Generator API](https://www.random.org/integers) to generate the number combinations. Please follow the recommended parameter values for simplicity:

- Number of integers requested: 4
- The smallest value returned: 0
- The largest value returned: 7
- Number of columns used to display the returned values: 1
- Use base 10 system
- Returns response in plain text
- Generate a new set of random numbers with each request

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the game application.
4. Start guessing and crack the code!

Enjoy playing Mastermind! If you have any issues or suggestions, feel free to contribute or open an issue. Good luck!
